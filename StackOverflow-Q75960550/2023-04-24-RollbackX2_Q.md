A little more than two weeks ago, I posted a question titled :

## ['6 high severity vulnerabilities' in a fresh Create React App](https://stackoverflow.com/q/75960550)

Here is [revision 1 of my question](https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/75960550/1).

And for your convenience, here is [the Markdown source of revision 1](https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/8de85fe0-b9f3-4be0-ab14-a8cf65081aa3/view-source).

An editor made a rather extensive edit of my post that I didn't like, so I rolled it back.
 <sup>1</sup>

## Changes made by the editor that I disagree with

1. The editor removed my summary of the six actions I had tried that didn't work.

2. He removed the `package.json` file I had included and without which it is impossible to reproduce my example (with the exact package version(s) I used).

3. Most of all, *he removed the very question I was asking* : \
***How can I *force* `package.json` to use version `2.1.1` of `nth-check`?*** \
That's right.
*My question no longer contains the question asked*. (!)

The grande finale of the editor's actions was that he rolled back my rollback.

I've never experienced anything even remotely similar to these events.

## What should I do now?

I'm asking the community for advice on what to do in a situation like this.

Here is [the timeline of the post](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/75960550/timeline).

### Background: some of my communication with the editor

Since [comments are meant to be ephemeral](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/312002), here are two of the question's comments.

Thanks for suggesting an edit to my question. However, I cannot accept an edit that *removes* the `package.json` from it. The `package.json` is what makes my post [a "minimal, complete and verifiable example"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Please don't suggest edits that remove such vital information! The [post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/15806152) that you suggest that my question is a duplicate of, is missing precisely this information.

The command you run already minimally reproduces it. If you'd like to go the other route, package file then install, only *one* dependency is needed: react-scripts (and that doesn't necessitate restoring the aesthetic catastrophe that was the rest of your first attempt). And no you don't "own" the post, see [stackoverflow.com/help/editing](https://stackoverflow.com/help/editing) for a better understanding of the collaborative model here.

Ironically, the only upvote my question has received so far came *within seconds* after my rollback.
